This repository contains the materials used in the paper.
The main file, Nucleo Atomic Vis, is the core project: it holds the code and workflows discussed in the manuscript.

The remaining files are supporting scripts used during development to automate tests, generate intermediate data, or check calculations. They’re included for transparency and reproducibility, but they’re not meant to be polished tools.

Some of those helper scripts may not run cleanly on every setup. They rely on specific environment details (Python/package versions, graphics backends, system drivers, etc.), so depending on your machine they might throw errors or behave differently. They’re provided as-is to document the process.
